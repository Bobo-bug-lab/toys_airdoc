During my internship, I worked on configuring an ARM-Linux cross-compilation environment in Ubuntu and completed several projects. Additionally, I submitted files to the company's Git repository. Specifically, I worked on the following:

- Boost Library and Demo: Cross-compiled and ported the Boost library and developed a demo program using the library, including implementing a timer management class (see boosttimer_demo.cpp in the Boost folder).

- OpenCV Program: Assisted in developing an image detection program for embedded devices to detect cracks in a material and optimized it to run within 10ms on the ARM platform. Also, developed a demo program for strip detection using the OpenCV library.

- Software Modularization: Tested, packaged, cross-compiled and ported several open-source tools including the Dbus library, Qrencode library, and Protobuf library. Additionally, compiled the SO dynamic library for the Tar tool to provide compression and decompression functions on the ARM device through functions.
